# 📊 BUD-MI repository
This GitHub repository contains the BUD-MI Template, developed with three key objectives in mind:
1. Streamlining data collection during building sampling,
2. Supporting cumulative research while maintaining project-specific relevance, and
3. Enhancing the practical value of results for the construction industry.

BUD-MI is intended to help researchers, students, and construction practitioners calculate a building’s material intensity in alignment with these three objectives.
BUD-MI consists of three data input tabs, two mini-tools for data input assistance, four result generation tabs, and additional tabs for background data and ancillary information, for a total of sixteen (16) tabs.
BUD-MI supports future material intensity data collection efforts, ensuring data quality, granularity, comparability, transferability, and availability, thereby advancing socioeconomic metabolism and circular economy research and practices.

This space allows users to **download the latest version**, **suggest improvements**, and **track updates** over time.
